Description: R implementation and interface of the Machine Learning platform 
    'PyTorch' <https://pytorch.org/> developed in Python. It requires a conda 
    environment with 'torch' and 'torchvision' to provide PyTorch functions, 
    methods and classes. The key object in PyTorch is the tensor which is in
    essence a multidimensional array. These tensors are fairly flexible to perform
    calculations in CPUs as well as GPUs.
